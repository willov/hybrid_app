# Digital twins and hybrid modelling for simulation of physiological variables and stroke risk

This repository contains the code for the eHealth application prototype developed in the the publication titled \"Digital twins and hybrid modelling for simulation of physiological variables and stroke risk\", [available as a preprint on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.25.485803v1). 

The prototype is hosted at [https://hybrid.streamlit.app](https://hybrid.streamlit.app), but can also be run locally. To do that, install the required packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file, and run `streamlit run Home.py` in the terminal. If using `uv`, you only need to run:

```bash
uv run streamlit run Home.py
```

Please note that the application can take a few minutes to start up, primarily when running at [https://hybrid.streamlit.app](https://hybrid.streamlit.app), but also locally. Also note that a valid C-compiler is necessary for running the application locally.
